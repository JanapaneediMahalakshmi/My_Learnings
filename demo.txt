MERGE CONFLICTS:
-> When Git cannot automatically merge changes, it will prompt you to resolve conflicts manually. 
-> Edit the conflicting files, then add and commit them
-> This typically happens during a merge operation. 

-----------
REBASE:
-> Rebasing in GitHub is a process that allows you to move or combine a sequence of commits from one branch onto another, effectively rewriting the commit history
-> Rebasing applies your changes directly on top of the target branch, resulting in a cleaner, linear history.
-> Unlike merging, which creates a new merge commit to combine branches.

Syntax:
-> git checkout <feature-branch>
-> git rebase <base-branch>

-----------

STASH:
Git command that allows you to temporarily save your uncommitted changes,and work on something.
-> git stash - Stash your changes
-> git stash push -m "message" - Stash with a message
-> git stash list - List all stashes
-> git stash branch <branchname> - Create a branch from a stash
