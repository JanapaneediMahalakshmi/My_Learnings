REBASE:
1. Rebasing in GitHub is a process that allows you to move or combine a sequence of commits from one branch onto another, effectively rewriting the commit history.
2. Rebasing applies your changes directly on top of the target branch, resulting in a cleaner, linear history.
3. Unlike merging, which creates a new merge commit to combine branches.

Syntax:
-> git checkout <feature-branch>
-> git rebase <base-branch>
